This repository contains webpages for my personal website which can be found at
* [s13rw81.github.io](https://www.s13rw81.github.io)
* [souravbasu.in](https://www.souravbasu.in) and
Personally i think the GitHub URL is much neater, i would have not bought my
domain if I had known of this feature earlier.
Hope someday i would reach a point in life where the domain would be more
significant.
